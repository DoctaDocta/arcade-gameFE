===============================
This game was built on a Udacity provided engine. It teaches basic principles of object-oriented javascript, interacting with HTML canvas. 
===============================
The mechanics are simple, 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'. 
===============================
There is a lot left to build! I would love to see a menu screen, in which you can customize characters. I would love to have sound effects when the player bumps into the enemy, or wins the round. 

I would love to make the canvas bigger, and populate a bigger board. Also find a way to ramp up the amount of enemies based on the score/round number.
